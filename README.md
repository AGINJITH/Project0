# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript



    The topic chosen to have for the project is 'Global Warming'

    I have used information from many useful web sites. The website has four main pages and one reference and feedback page. Which can be accessed from the home page. 


    The main folder has mainly index.html file and its stylesheet which is a CSS file and folders containing other web pages. They are following.

    /Effects
    /Flod
    /Hurrican
    /Reference

    And one folder containing all the photos on the website page.

    /Photos

    The folder has mainly two files which is an HTML file of all the pages and its stylesheet.  

    I have only used sass in for the web page that's in Reference folder.

	Last but not least all the pages on the website is mobile responsive. Last but not least all the pages on the website is mobile responsive. And all the criteria for the Project0 are followed.


	Thank you.
